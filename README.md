{ggborderline} provides a set of geoms to make line plots a little bit
nicer. Use this package along with
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to:

- Improve the clarity of line plots with many overlapping lines
- Draw more realistic worms

## Usage

You can use ggborderline by swapping out {ggplot2} line geoms with their
‘`border`’ equivalents. For example, here is the effect of swapping
`ggplot2::geom_line()` for `geom_borderline()`. Notice the white outline
of lines in the first plot where different lines intersect:

``` r
library(ggborderline)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

p <- txhousing |>
  filter(
    city %in% c("Houston", "Midland", "Beaumont", "Laredo"),
    !is.na(median)
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(date, median, colour = city)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar()) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

p + geom_borderline(linewidth = 1) + ggtitle("Using `geom_borderline()`")
p + geom_line(linewidth = 1) + ggtitle("Using `geom_line()`")
```

This effect is best applied conservatively, hence the ‘default’ settings
will only make a subtle (but hopefully positive) difference to existing
plots. However you can still adjust the `borderwidth` and `bordercolour`
aesthetics. Notice that the border is also much more noticable in the
legend too:

``` r
library(ggdark)

p + 
  geom_borderline(
    aes(bordercolour = after_scale(invert_colour(colour))),
    borderwidth = 1, linewidth = 2
  )
```

```

# Inspiration

I made this package after seeing this plot tweeted by [Rosamund
Pearce](https://twitter.com/_rospearce), an experience that forever
soured me to lines without borders:

# Other Approaches

While these effects can be achieved using {ggplot2} alone if you have
the patience, there are other packages which provide other methods for
achieving bordered lines. [{ggfx}](https://ggfx.data-imaginist.com/) is
much more powerful, but would perhaps be overkill for something as
simple as adding a border around a line.
[{ggshadow}](https://github.com/marcmenem/ggshadow) is another great
alternative which implements the shadow using a slightly different
approach, and also comes with some other handy features. You are
encouraged to try both!

# Credit

This package would not have been possible without the fantastic
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package, and would have been
very difficult without the [accompanying
book](https://ggplot2-book.org/). My humble and sincere thanks go to all
the authors and developers who make projects like this possible.
