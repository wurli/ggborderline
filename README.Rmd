{ggborderline} provides a set of geoms to make line plots a little bit nicer. Use
this package along with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to:

* Improve the clarity of line plots with many overlapping lines
* Draw more realistic worms

## Usage

Simply changing `ggplot2::geom_line()` for `geom_borderline()` can make a big
difference:

```{r example, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.width = 5}
library(ggborderline)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(patchwork)

plot <- economics_long %>% 
  group_by(year = lubridate::year(date), variable) %>% 
  summarise(yearly_total = sum(value01), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  filter(year %in% 1970:2010) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, yearly_total, colour = variable)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

plot + geom_borderline() + ggtitle("Using `geom_borderline()`")
plot + geom_line() + ggtitle("Using `geom_line()`")
```

x <- seq(-1, 0.5, length.out = 500)
worm_data <- data.frame(
  x = rep(x, 2), y = c(sin(x * pi), cos(x * pi)),
  colour = rep(c("pink", "pink2"), each = 500)
)

dirt <- c("#453d30", "#453d30", "#988b77", "#856e52", "#695e48")

  x = runif(30000, -1.1, 0.6), y = runif(30000, -1.1, 1.1),
  colour = sample(dirt, 10000, replace = TRUE)
)

ggplot(worm_data, aes(x, y, colour = colour)) +
  geom_point(data = colours, size = 2.5, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_borderline(size = 10, bordersize = 1, bordercolour = "pink3", lineend = "round") +

# Installation

You can install the development version of ggborderline from [github](https://github.com/wurli/ggborderline) with:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("wurli/ggborderline")
```

# Inspiration
I made this package after seeing this plot tweeted by [Rosamund Pearce](https://twitter.com/_rospearce),
an experience that forever soured me to lines without borders:

# Other Approaches
While these effects can be achieved using {ggplot2} alone if you have the
patience, there are other packages which provide other methods for achieving bordered
lines. [{ggfx}](https://ggfx.data-imaginist.com/) is much more powerful, but 
would perhaps be overkill for something as simple as adding a border around a line.
[{ggshadow}](https://github.com/marcmenem/ggshadow) is another great alternative
which implements the shadow using a slightly different approach, and also comes with
some other handy features. You are encouraged to try both!

# Credit
This package would not have been possible without the fantastic [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
package, and would have been very difficult without the [accompanying book](https://ggplot2-book.org/). 
My humble and sincere thanks go to all the authors who make projects like this possible.
