{ggborderline} provides a set of geoms to make line plots a little bit nicer. Use
this package along with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to:

* Improve the clarity of line plots with many overlapping lines
* Draw more realistic worms

## Usage

You can use ggborderline by swapping out {ggplot2} line geoms with their '`border`'
equivalents. For example, here is the effect of swapping `ggplot2::geom_line()` 
for `geom_borderline()`. Notice the white outline of lines in the first plot where
different lines intersect:

```{r example, fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.width=5}
library(ggborderline)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

p <- txhousing |>
  filter(
    city %in% c("Houston", "Midland", "Beaumont", "Laredo"),
    !is.na(median)
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(date, median, colour = city)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar()) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

p + geom_borderline(linewidth = 1) + ggtitle("Using `geom_borderline()`")
p + geom_line(linewidth = 1) + ggtitle("Using `geom_line()`")
```

This effect is best applied conservatively, hence the 'default' settings
will only make a subtle (but hopefully positive) difference to existing plots. 
However you can still adjust the `borderwidth` and `bordercolour` aesthetics.
Notice that the border is also much more noticable in the legend too:
```{r}
library(ggdark)

plot + 
  geom_borderline(
    aes(bordercolour = after_scale(invert_colour(colour))),
    borderwidth = 1, linewidth = 2
  )
```

# Inspiration
I made this package after seeing this plot tweeted by [Rosamund Pearce](https://twitter.com/_rospearce),
an experience that forever soured me to lines without borders:

# Other Approaches
While these effects can be achieved using {ggplot2} alone if you have the
patience, there are other packages which provide other methods for achieving bordered
lines. [{ggfx}](https://ggfx.data-imaginist.com/) is much more powerful, but 
would perhaps be overkill for something as simple as adding a border around a line.
[{ggshadow}](https://github.com/marcmenem/ggshadow) is another great alternative
which implements the shadow using a slightly different approach, and also comes with
some other handy features. You are encouraged to try both!

# Credit
This package would not have been possible without the fantastic [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
package, and would have been very difficult without the [accompanying book](https://ggplot2-book.org/). 
My humble and sincere thanks go to all the authors and developers who make projects like this possible.
